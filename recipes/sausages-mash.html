    <h1>Sauasge & Mash Recipe</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 chicken bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>8 links pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced and separated into rings</li>
        <li>2 (10.25 ounce) cans homestyle beef gravy</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons crumbled dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pan and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, leaving potatoes in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir bouillon cubes into warm milk until dissolved. Stir milk mixture and melted butter into potatoes. Mash potatoes until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Prick sausages in a few places with a fork. Cook sausages in hot oil, turning often, until golden brown and juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness. Remove sausages from the skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Add onion rings to the same skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until rings are golden but still crisp, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat gravy in a small pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Scoop mashed potatoes onto a large serving plate. Arrange sausages over potatoes; top with onion rings, drizzle with warm gravy, and sprinkle with oregano.</li>
    </ol>
