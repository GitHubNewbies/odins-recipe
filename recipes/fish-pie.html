        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li> 1 (1 pound) fillet cod </li>
        <li> ½ cup butter, divided </li>
        <li>1 medium leek, white part only, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 ounces grated sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>

        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 hard-boiled eggs, quartered (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool.</li>
            <li>Combine milk, bay leaf, and nutmeg in a large pan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Add cod and poach until flaky, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer cod onto a plate; reserve poaching liquid. Use a fork to flake fish into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Mash potatoes in a large bowl. Mix in 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons poaching liquid until potatoes are fairly stiff and not too runny.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat and stir in leek. Cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 1/4-cup butter over medium heat in a large, deep skillet until it just stops bubbling. Add flour and stir roux continuously for 1 minute. Slowly pour in remaining poaching liquid, continuously stirring, to make base of sauce. Add 1/2 of sharp Cheddar cheese and stir until melted. Fold in flaked cod, leek, and peas. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place fish mixture in an oven-proof dish; press boiled eggs gently into filling across the surface. Cover with a thick layer of mashed potatoes. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese.</li>
           <li> Bake in the preheated oven until top is starting to brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
